Perform audio signal processing to extract features and recommend songs for existing/new music file.


### Usage

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py to run Flask app

Note: Recommended songs will not play since the audio files are not available. Ideally, all audio files present in the dataset would be present in uploads folder
